# Opening a PR
Once you open a pull request, ChaosBot will give it X seconds (where X is
determined by github\_api.voting.get\_voting\_window)
before collecting votes.  During this time, you should let people know about
your contribution, so that they may vote for it and ensure your hard work gets
merged in.  If you do not wish for ChaosBot to consider your PR for merging just
yet, add "WIP" somewhere in your PR title.  Remove it when you're ready for voting.

# Changing your PR
You may change your PR at any time without losing votes, but keep in mind, any
new changes will reset the vote window for additional time.

# Merging your PR
At the end of the voting window, ChaosBot will review the votes, and if your PR
crosses a threshold, your changes will be merged in.  To thank you for your merged
contribution, ChaosBot will then follow you on GitHub.  If your changes are not
merged in, take the time to consider the feedback you received, and create a new
PR with changes you believe people will be willing to vote for.
