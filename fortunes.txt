The brain is a beautifully engineered get-out-of-the-way machine that
constantly scans the environment for things out of whose way it should
right now get. That's what brains did for several hundred million years ―
and then, just a few million years ago, the mammalian brain learned a new
trick: to predict the timing and location of dangers before they actually
happened.

Our ability to duck that which is not yet coming is one of the brain's most
stunning innovations, and we wouldn't have dental floss or 401(k) plans
without it. But this innovation is in the early stages of development. The
application that allows us to respond to visible baseballs is ancient and
reliable, but the add-on utility that allows us to respond to threats that
loom in an unseen future is still in beta testing.

A little retrospection shows that although many fine, useful software systems
have been designed by committees and built as part of multipart projects,
those software systems that have excited passionate fans are those that are
the products of one or a few designing minds, great designers. Consider Unix,
APL, Pascal, Modula, the Smalltalk interface, even Fortran; and contrast them
with Cobol, PL/I, Algol, MVS/370, and MS-DOS.

Every Horse has an Infinite Number of Legs (proof by intimidation):
Horses have an even number of legs. Behind they have two legs, and in
front they have fore-legs. This makes six legs, which is certainly an
odd number of legs for a horse. But the only number that is both even
and odd is infinity. Therefore, horses have an infinite number of
legs. Now to show this for the general case, suppose that somewhere,
there is a horse that has a finite number of legs. But that is a horse
of another color, and by the [above] lemma ["All horses are the same
color"], that does not exist.

sometimes connote points along a continuum. FROB connotes aimless

search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes fine-tuning. If someone is
turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it
he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the

it. To turn back now would be to deny our history, our capabilities.

The reason ESP, for example, is not considered a viable topic in

fruitful...After more than 70 years of study, there still does not exist
one example of an ESP phenomenon that is replicable under controlled
conditions. This simple but basic scientific criterion has not been met
despite dozens of studies conducted over many decades... It is for this
reason alone that the topic is now of little interest to psychology... In
short, there is no demonstrated phenomenon that needs explanation.

program going as fast as you possibly can, which is really nothing more than
doing a sort of crossword puzzle.

The truth is that Christian theology, like every other theology, is not only
opposed to the scientific spirit; it is also opposed to all other attempts

days the church as an organization has thrown itself violently against every
effort to liberate the body and mind of man. It has been, at all times and

When a candidate for public office faces the voters he does not face men of
sense; he faces a mob of men whose chief distinguishing mark is the fact that
they are quite incapable of weighing ideas, or even of comprehending any save
the most elemental — men whose whole thinking is done in terms of emotion, and
whose dominant emotion is dread of what they cannot understand. So confronted,
the candidate must either bark with the pack or be lost... All the odds are on
the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre — the man who can
most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The
Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected,
the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We
move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of
the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be

talent and rigorous training are denigrated. We want elite pilots to fly our

represent us in competition and elite scientists to devote the most productive
years of their lives to curing our diseases. And yet, when it comes time to
vest people with even greater responsibilities, we consider it a virtue to shun
any and all standards of excellence. When it comes to choosing the people whose

We’ve bought into the idea that education is about training and
"success", defined monetarily, rather than learning to think critically
and to challenge. We should not forget that the true purpose of education
is to make minds, not careers. A culture that does not grasp the vital
interplay between morality and power, which mistakes management techniques
for wisdom, which fails to understand that the measure of a civilization
is its compassion, not its speed or ability to consume, condemns itself
to death.

Inverted totalitarianism, unlike classical totalitarianism, does not
revolve around a demagogue or charismatic leader. It finds expression in
the anonymity of the Corporate State. It purports to cherish democracy,
patriotism, and the Constitution while manipulating internal levers.

Washington has become our Versailles. We are ruled, entertained,
and informed by courtiers―and the media has evolved into a class of
courtiers. The Democrats, like the Republicans, are mostly courtiers. Our
pundits and experts, at least those with prominent public platforms,
are courtiers. We are captivated by the hollow stagecraft of political
theater as we are ruthlessly stripped of power. It is smoke and mirrors,
tricks and con games, and the purpose behind it is deception.

The split in America, rather than simply economic, is between those who
embrace reason, who function in the real world of cause and effect, and those
who, numbed by isolation and despair, now seek meaning in a mythical world
of intuition, a world that is no longer reality-based, a world of magic.

Hope has a cost. Hope is not comfortable or easy. Hope requires personal
risk. It is not about the right attitude. Hope is not about peace of
mind. Hope is action. Hope is doing something. The more futile, the more
useless, the more irrelevant and incomprehensible an act of rebellion is,
the vaster and more potent hope becomes.  Hope never makes sense. Hope is
weak, unorganized and absurd. Hope, which is always nonviolent, exposes in
its powerlessness, the lies, fraud and coercion employed by the state. Hope
knows that an injustice visited on our neighbor is an injustice visited on
all of us. Hope posits that people are drawn to the good by the good. This
is the secret of hope's power. Hope demands for others what we demand for
ourselves. Hope does not separate us from them. Hope sees in our enemy
our own face.
